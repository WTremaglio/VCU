# Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU)
This repository is a collection of my computer science work from attending Virginia Commonwealth University. This includes work done for the following 
classes:<br>
<ul>
  <li> CMSC 255 - Intro to Computer Science </li>
  <li> CMSC 256 - Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming (Not yet implemented.)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<em> Disclaimer: Due to medical complications that resulted in many absences, I chose to repeat CMSC 255 despite passing the course. I made this decision to 
ensure a strong foundation in Computer Science fundamentals. </em>
